# My NeoVim config
I don't know why you're here, just because I've made this repo public doens't
mean I know ANYTHING about this stuff at all!

It just took me way too long to set it up the way I can use and I didn't want
to lose it! That's why it's here. 


## For future reference
In case I magically got really good at this stuff or I just want to understand
what the hell I've done in the future, here's a quick explanation on what
everything is:


### Package manager
So I use Packer as my package manager. Every dependency is defined in 
`lua/saeeconfig/packer.lua`
and then the setup part is done in 
`after/{packagename}.lua`

simple as that!
